# Railway Provider

This provider is used to interact with the many resources supported by [Railway](https://railway.app).

## Authentication

This provider requires a Railway API token in order to manage resources.

To manage the full selection of resources, provide a user token from an account with appropriate permissions.

There are several ways to provide the required token:

* **Set the `token` argument in the provider configuration**. You can set the `token` argument in the provider configuration. Use an input variable for the token.
* **Set the `RAILWAY_TOKEN` environment variable**. The provider can read the `RAILWAY_TOKEN` environment variable and the token stored there to authenticate.

## Example Usage

provider "railway" {}
